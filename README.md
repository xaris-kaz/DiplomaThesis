Network programming in the operating system(Kernel)  

This thesis focuses on the description and analysis of Netgraph, a subsystem used to add
network functionalities to the FreeBSD operating system. Initially, the purpose of the
thesis is described, presenting the historical development and usability of Netgraph. The
second chapter explains the architecture of Netgraph, its fundamental structures such as
nodes, hooks, and other Netgraph components, followed by an in-depth technical analysis
of these structures. Examples of connections between the structures are also provided.
The third chapter addresses the installation and practical use of Netgraph, presenting
both the installation processes and the application of utilities programs like ngctl. The
fourth chapter is dedicated to the creation of a node in Netgraph, detailing the
interconnection, the flow and handling of data packets and control messages, as well as
interventions at the TCP/IP protocol stack levels. The fifth and final chapter refers to an
example of custom node creation, specifically the development of the ng_triple_tee node,
presenting its concept and implementation.
